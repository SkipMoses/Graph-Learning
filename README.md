# Graph-Learning
This a repo for the Data Science Cap-Stone.
This repo contains code for learning a graph adjacnecy matrix from binary signals. In order run this code the library [CVXPY.](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/) The main code file is found in the [binary_graph_learning.py](https://github.com/SkipMoses/Graph-Learning/blob/main/Code/binary_graph_learning/binary_graph_learning.py) and a python notebook with an example of the algorithm working on an Erdos-Reyni graph is in [erdos_reyni.ipynb](https://github.com/SkipMoses/Graph-Learning/blob/main/Code/binary_graph_learning/erdos_reyni.ipynb)

For an overview of graph learning see the survey found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9416834)
